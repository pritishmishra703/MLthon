# MLthon

## About

In this GitHub Repository, I have made many Machine learning Algorithms from scratch.

You can learn what is happening Under The Hood of all these Algorithms (or Mathematics)

## Installation

```
pip install mlthon
```

## How to use?

Documentation of this package is not yet available. We will be making an Official Documentation of this Package in near future when this package is fully created! Till then explore on your own.

Note: This Repository is under construction and new Algorithms will be added soon. You can too contribute!
